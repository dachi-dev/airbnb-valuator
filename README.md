scraper.py is the module responsible for scraping airbnb. It uses selenium to navigate to a list of cities, scrape the listings, and return data that is used in our data fusion engine.
To run it, install the python dependencies and run `python scraper.py`, by default it uses the geckodriver (Firefox), so you should see that browser open up unless you have it in headless mode (recommended for prod).
